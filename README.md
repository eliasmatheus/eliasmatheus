# Elias Matheus
## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹, 
My name is Elias Matheus Melo de Oliveira, start my career in civil engineering :construction:, however, I discovered my true vocation in the area of technology.

So I decided to change careers and embark on the journey to become a :rocket: web developer.

To help me in this process, I chose to do Front-End training at [Newtab Academy](https://www.newtab.academy/), where I have learned from the fundamentals of the Web such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, to the challenges of being part of an agile development team.

Also, to learn the best technologies on the market I boarded the [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) rocket in the GoStack 13 bootcamp.

Today I work as a front-end developer, and I'm specializing in Angular, but I also do some projects in Next.js.

Welcome and make yourself comfortable!
